The COCO dataset is described as follows:

COCO API - [http://cocodataset.org/](http://cocodataset.org/)

COCO is a large image dataset designed for object detection, segmentation, person keypoints detection, stuff segmentation, and caption generation. This package provides Matlab, Python, and Lua APIs that assists in loading, parsing, and visualizing the annotations in COCO. Please visit [http://cocodataset.org/](http://cocodataset.org/) for more information on COCO, including for the data, paper, and tutorials. The exact format of the annotations is also described on the COCO website. The Matlab and Python APIs are complete, the Lua API provides only basic functionality.

The dataset we provide that interfaces well with the COCO API, providing future researchers with uniform comparison guidelines as well as a platform for comparison.
